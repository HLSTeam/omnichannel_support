## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
Coordinator Bot → AI Analysis → Route Request → Target Workflow → Backend API → Response Aggregation
```

### Key Workflows
1. **Coordinator Bot Complete - Epic 1**: Main routing and orchestration
2. **Helpdesk Ticket Management - Epic 1**: Ticket creation and management
3. **AI Intent Analysis Core**: AI-powered request classification
4. **Notification System - Epic 1**: Automated notifications
5. **Health Monitoring & System Status - Epic 1**: System health checks
6. **Transaction Status API - Epic 1 Story 1.7**: Transaction monitoring
7. **Supplier Response Management - Epic 1 Story 1.8**: Supplier interactions

### Supported Commands & Intents
1. **`create_notification`** → Routes to Notification System workflow
2. **`check_logs`** → Routes to Logs workflow ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
3. **`create_ticket`** → Routes to Helpdesk workflow
4. **`check_trans`** → Routes to Transaction Status workflow
5. **`health_check`** → Routes to Health Monitoring workflow

### Missing Workflows (Technical Debt)
- **Logs Checking Workflow**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - `Check Logs - Epic 1` workflow created (needs manual activation)
- **Command Processing**: Limited command structure and validation
- **Log Analysis**: Basic mock logs data implemented
